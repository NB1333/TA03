This is the third laboratory work on algorithm theory. It implements linked list and doubly linked list, stack and queue based on them

A linked list is a dynamic data structure that consists of nodes in each of which there is a value and a reference to the next element.
Doubly limked list also contains a refernce to the previous element in each node. 
The linked list has the following advantages: 
• since the time is constant, the addition and removal of elements is fast 
• the size is limited only by the computer's memory 
• dynamic deletion and addition of objects is available
And disadvantages:
• you need to go through all the previous elements to get the necessary element
• if head node is lost, the entire list is lost
